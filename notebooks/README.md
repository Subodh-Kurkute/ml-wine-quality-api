# Notebooks (Documentation)

This directory contains markdown exports of Jupyter notebooks used during exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature understanding, and model evaluation.

The notebooks document:
- Data exploration and preprocessing decisions
- Feature distributions and correlations
- Model selection and evaluation rationale
- Key insights that informed the final model and thresholds

These files are provided **for documentation and transparency only**.  
All production code (training, evaluation, and serving) lives in the main Python modules and does not depend on these notebooks.

## Notes

- Raw notebooks (`.ipynb`) are intentionally excluded
- The final pipeline is fully reproducible without these files
- This separation keeps the repository clean and deployment-focused
